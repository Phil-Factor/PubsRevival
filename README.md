# PubsRevival
 The PUBS database was originally developed by Sybase as a database of a fictional shop that is selling books, and do require of information about publishers, authors, titles and the sales of their associated books.
 
The database is often used as a model database that you can experiment with.

We are using it to demonstrate Database Development with SQL Compare. This goes together with a Product Learning article.
